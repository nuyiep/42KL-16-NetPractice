Hosts
	- device that sends or receives traffic 
  - Hosts -> client or server
    client initiates requests, server responds 

  
IP address
  - identity of each host
  - 32 bits  
  - bit = 1 or 0
  - 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    represented as 4 octets
    1000 1000   .   0001 0110   .   0001 0001   .   0110 0010
      136       .       22      .        17     .      98    -->> IP address
  - each octet can be 0-255

Network
  - transports traffic between hosts

Repeaters 
  - regenerate signals
  - allow communications across greater distance

Hubs
  - multi-port repeaters
  - problem: everyone receives everyone else's data

Bridges
  - sit between Hub-connected hosts
  - contain info within hub

Switches
  - a combination of Hubs and Bridges
  - contain the info within the two host and client only
  - facilitate communication WITHIN a network 
  - network: grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity
  - hosts on a network share the same IP address space

Routers
  - facilitate communicate BETWEEN networks (internet)
  - provides a traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting)
  - stored in a routing table

Gateway
  - each host's way out of their local Network

Internet
  - a bunch of routers

OSI Model
	- rules for networking - 7 layers - together they can perform networking (GOAL)
  - Layer 1 - Physical - transporting bits
        - transport bits (1's and 0's) between hosts
        - **** E.g. Wires, cables, wi-fi, repeaters, hubs
  - Layer 2 - Data Link - hop to hop
        - Interacts with the Wire (i.e. physical layer)
            - NIC (Network Interface cards) / wi-fi access cards
        - Addressing scheme - MAC addresses
            - 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits
            - 94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5 / 94:65:9C:3B:8A:E5 / 9464.9C3B.8AE5
            - every NIC has a unique MAC address
        - ***** Eg. NICs, switches, Mac addresses
  - Layer 3 - Network - End to End
        - Addressing scheme - IP addresses
            - 32 bits, represented as 4 octets, each 0-255
        - ***** Eg. Routers, Hosts (anything with an IP)
 
 - ARP - address resolution protocol
       - links a L3 address to a L2 address
       - http://pracnet.net/arp

    
  - Layer 4 - Transport - Service to Service
        - Distinguish data streams
        - addressing scheme- ports
            0-65535 - TCP - favors reliability
            0-65535 - UDP - favors efficiency

L2:      b2b2 -> 8AE5
L3: 10.1.1.11 -> 192.168.1.99
L4: TCP 1025  -> 80
